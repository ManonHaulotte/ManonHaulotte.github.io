                             Academic research is about gathering new information and furthering human knowledge. It has the potential to spur critical thinking, inject nuance and depth to the the public discussion, inform decision-making, empower citizens, come up with new datas and smart solutions and help understand the complex world we live in. However, knowledge produced in universities largely goes unheeded and rarely influences thinking beyond the system in which it was constructed.
                           </p>
                          </div>
                    <p id="text2">
                    To bridge the devide between scholar communities and everyone else, we need to increase the discoverability, comprehension, use and diffusion of academic findings. It’s about time for a global movement that pushes academic evidence out into the world in an accessible format so that it does not sit idle behind journal paywalls but makes a difference in the world in which we live.

                     Academia is all things relating to universities and research. Accessibility is a big concept, but here I’m mainly talking about the accessibility of information and research. This (in my view) is about making it possible for everyone to understand your information/research, and making it useful for the people it’s about but we know at the very least that the research is getting out there and not just sitting in paywalled academic journals.

gratification can also come from communicating concepts in a more open and accessible way and as a result seeing your work active in the world.  engage readers with your research an academic system that rewards researchers for output and not necessarily influence, to name a few. No change will occur unless, as one commentary notes, “the system of rewards is changed.”The biggest hurdle is that academia has yet to find an incentive for them to take time away from the lab to engage the public. Universities still operate under an ancient system that values only scholarly output.” He suggests instead that we establish a system that also rewards academics who engage and share their knowledge with the public via traditional, new and social media too. Journals and citation counts are no longer enough. But not least, part of the blame is surely the result of a system that looks down upon or at least disregards academic engagement with media, policy-makers and the wider world it claims to address. The truth is, few beyond the academy know or read academic journals. It would be a small – but critical – step for academics to tell audiences why their research matters. Presumably much of the research in journal articles would and should matter to those beyond academic circles, particularly those who are in the business of creating policy. The beginnings of a global movement
We hope that the bridge we’ve helped build between mainstream media and academic research sets a precedent for further exchanges and participation between these two distinct groups. Op-eds offer a unique way for women to control their voice and message and still push their expertise out to wider audiences. Not surprisingly, then, in recent years academics have shown a growing interest in non-traditional ways of evaluating their scholarly ‘impact’. These altmetrics, short for alternative metrics, allow researchers to gauge the impact and reach of their research in the social web beyond traditional citation counting. but a motivation for researcher (see impact, inspiration) but also positive social impact arm potential change makers with best available knowledge

  The time has come, he suggests, for academics to engage beyond journal articles and communicate their evidence and ideas to a broader interested public.
  The challenge for many academics is that even if they want to engage in such public discussions – to go where the audiences already are, in traditional, new and social media – they don’t often know how to go about it, and few have the time or the resources to do it properly.

  . So we decided to do that for them. What started out as an experiment in 2011 has blossomed into a full media service for academics and a clearing house of high-quality,
  EvidenceNetwork.ca acts as a mediator and editorial service for academics


  They are asked to write a rough draft of their op-ed. We guide them on how to proceed with the first draft – the dos and don’ts of the process. After that, we take it from there. Our editorial team works on tightening up the op-ed, with the needs of specific media outlets in mind. Rough drafts are often trimmed to specific word counts, the argument is tightened and jargon-laced language is excised in favour of plain or conversational language suiting traditional op-ed style.
   then check with them


  The author is part of this process throughout. The op-ed routinely goes through three or more rounds of edits, and if the material is controversial or political in any way, it goes through an informal peer review process with other experts vetting the piece for balance and accuracy. All points of evidence are hyperlinked to their sources. Once we are certain the
   piece is ready for the media, we secure author approval, and then EvidenceNetwork.ca shops the op-ed to the major media outlets on behalf of the author.
